# Behavioral transfer for self driving with CARLA

### Generating Training data
- client_example.py is used for generating training data
- Replace the client_example.py in PythonClient folder in CARLA

  #### Execution steps

  1. run server: ./CarlaUE4.sh -carla-server -benchmark -fps=15 -windowed -ResX=800 -ResY=600
  -  Add SDL_VIDEODRIVER=offscreen SDL_HINT_CUDA_DEVICE=0 before ./Carla to disable rendering
  2. run client: python client_example.py -i -q Low -a -l -sem

  #### Output Information

  Output is generated in a folder called _out, with a new folder per episode. Each episode contains 

  - measurement
  - camerargb
  - depthmap
  - lidar
  - segmentation: the images will appear black, a converter has to be used from Utils/ImageConverter to get the segmented image. 
    Usage: ./bin/image_converter -c semseg -i ../../PythonClient/_out/episode_0000/SemanticSegmentation/ -o output/folder
